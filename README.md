# Ollama CLI

Forked and modified from Gemini-Cli :
https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli

Works for analyzing content and directories, but I am working on getting tools
to work with dumb small models. Most of the models are too dumb/small to
understand what to do, and the big ones are too slow for as many operations that
they need to perform.

PR's are more than welcomed!
